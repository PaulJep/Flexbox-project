                <p class="story">An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the
                    domestic or
                    orchard apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown
                    species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus
                    sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were
                    introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological
                    significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
                    Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant
                    fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including botanical
                    evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown
                    without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to
                    control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.
                    There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples.</p>
